# Advent of Code

[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles, made by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl), since 2015, that can be solved in any programming language.
In my case, I choose to solve with [NodeJs](#technology-stack), to train more this language.

## Programming Puzzles

## My Goal

My ***main goal*** is to train and achieve the ***problem solve skill***. Because the puzzles of advent of code force you to think out the box to get creative solutions.
Also, solving this puzzles with NodeJs, will help me to understand better how this programming language works, and will instigate me to know more about the ***algoritms and data structure*** relationated to this.

## How I've Working
