# Advent of Code 2020

[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles, made by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) that can be solved in any programming language.
In my case, I choose to solve with **[NodeJs](https://github.com/nathaliaitaliano/advent-of-code#technology-stack)**, to train more this language.

## Technology Stack
> [NodeJs](https://nodejs.dev/download) --version 14.15.4
>
> [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/#installation) --version 8.3.2
