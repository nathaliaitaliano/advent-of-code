# Advent of Code 2020

[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles, made by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) that can be solved in any programming language.
In my case, I choose to solve with **[NodeJs](#technology-stack)**, to train more this language.
